        Produce an attestation vote for the given slot and validator.

        This method constructs a Vote object according to the lean protocol
        specification for attestation voting. The vote represents the
        validator's view of the chain state and their choice for the
        next justified checkpoint.

        The algorithm:
        1. Get the current head
        2. Calculate the appropriate vote target using current forkchoice state
        3. Use the store's latest justified checkpoint as the vote source
        4. Construct and return the complete Vote object

        Args:
            slot: The slot for which to produce the attestation vote.
            validator_index: The validator index producing the vote.

        Returns:
            A fully constructed Attestation object ready for signing and broadcast.
